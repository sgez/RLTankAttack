Abstract and very general gameplay description and rules.


= Definitions =

  * The players are 2 *boats*.
  * A *lock tank* is a water column that can be drained or filled via valves with water.
  * The *water tank* on which the two boats can float, consists of a finite number of lock tanks.
  * a *valve* controls water level in a lock tank.

= Rules =
  * Each boat starts over dry land (far left or far right).
  * Each player when in turn can do only one action at a time (description bellow).
  * A boat can overlap another other boat.
  * A boat must reside over dry land or a water sprite that is at most one level drained.
  *The number of valves is double the number of lock tanks.
  * Each water lock tack can be drained or filled by one level via 2 valves (1 up, 1 down).
  * If a boat is over a column that is drained by more than 1 levels, then the boat is destroyed.
  * If a boat is not over water (as described above) or not over dry land, then it is destroyed.
