#summary RLGraph Building

= Introduction =

The games/ directory holds actions and states. The best data structure to hold everything in one place is a directional weighted graph, with its node being the state, the edge being the action the the weight will be the value.


= Details =

The graph that can be produced is shown here:

On the example above, the RLGraph studies /games/#/moves/# directories and shows 5 games with 2 resulting to winning for the AI (node 1) and 3 in loosing (node -1).

For practical reasons, the node name is an md5'ed version of the arrays wl, p1 and p2.

The action array is embedded at the edge.

The value derived based on the reward will be added as weight to the edges.
