#summary "Load Move From Text File" Algorithm

= Introduction =

Algorithm description on how AI will write a file as a current move and not a logged move, so that the GUI and the key arrays are reproduced. 
AI will be able to create p2 or wl array (wl could have an effect on p1 or p2).

= Details =

Variable G_move holds current move. Variable G_game holds current game. 
G_move is the move that is about to be recorded via savemove() that logs p1, p2 and wl states after a move is performed.

  * If (./games/[G_game]/moves/[G_move]/p2) file or If (./games/[G_game]/moves/[G_move]/wl) file exists and (./games/[G_game]/moves/[G_move]/p1) does not exist i.e. (('p2' || 'wl') and not 'p1')
then:
    # If it is BOATS_TURN=1 (human is 0, AI is 1)
    # If move is valid for boat or for water level based on prior states
      # if wl move lowers boat then lower p1 or p2 boat
      # skip mouse event wait via a flag AI_skip_mouse_flag
      # run against game_state(p1, p2, wl) to get reward
      # Toggle WHOSE_TURN
