Machine Learning Mechanisms and their Use in Validating the Quality of Novel Games

Aug 31, 2012  

Open University of Cyprus

Our objective is to use existing knowhow with reinforcement learning and its implementation technology to automatically discover tactics in a game, so that the learning mechanisms can be used in novel games, currently uder developement. In this thesis we are trying to design a new zero-sum between two players and validate its properties (e.g fairness based on a random game, learning speed based on its complexity etc.) and the computers ability to learn by observing other players (humans or not).
